# Xavier
This repository hosts code for Xavier, a personal assistant powered by Artificial Intelligence (in development).

## Introduction
The end goal of this project is to create an assistant which replicates functionality similar to Tony Stark's *Jarvis*. While working towards this goal, the team is working on smaller projects such as image labeling. This project uses the following languages and libraries:
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org)
